## Working Papers
1.  **“The ‘Ripple Effect’ of Criminally Accused Politicians on Crime in India” (with [V. Bahure](https://example.com) ); under R & R.**

- We analyzed the impact of criminally accused politicians (CAPs) on local crime rates in Indian state assemblies
using regression discontinuity in Stata and double/debiased machine learning in Python. We constructed local
crime data from approx. 81 million court cases provided by DevData Lab via R text analytics and politician
data (2007–2016) through Python web scraping of the ADR MyNeta portals. We found significant increases in
aggregate crimes, crimes against women, and property crimes following CAP elections, along with economic
downturns, reduced public trust, and judicial delays, which likely contributed to the rise in crime.s

2. **“Education and Domestic Violence: Evidence from a School Construction Program in India” (with M. Agarwal,V. Bahure, K. Bergonzoli); SITES Working Papers No. 17, 2024.**

- We investigated the 2015‑16 and 2019‑21 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data using a fuzzy regression dis‑
continuity design and IV regression in Stata to assess the impact of India’s District Primary Education Program
(DPEP) on domestic violence. Our findings show increased women’s education significantly reduced domes‑
tic violence: emotional violence fell by 13%, less severe physical violence by 26%, and sexual violence by 9%.
These reductions stemmed primarily from improved gender attitudes, better partner quality, and greater ac‑
cess to legal and informational support

3. **“Development Assistance and Crime‑Accused Politicians: Evidence from Indian Elections” (with U. Das);under Review.**

- We investigated whether development assistance (DA) project financial flows affect the entry of candidates with
criminal or serious crime accusations in politics. Using geocoded World Bank DA projects with ArcGIS and politi‑
cian data obtained via Python web scraping from ADR Myneta, our multi‑way fixed effects analysis of 2008–2015
Indian elections found weak evidence that such projects may increase first‑time candidates with these accu‑
sations; however, instrumental variable regression found no effect of legislators’ criminal accusations on the
project performance and evaluation ratings.

## Work in Progress
1. **“Exploring the Duality: Economic and Environmental Consequences of Chinese Development Finance” (with S. Roy).**
2. **”Assessing the Interplay: Trade Liberalization and the Structural Reconfiguration of Global Supply Chains”.**
